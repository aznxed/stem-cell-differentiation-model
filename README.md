**Basic Stem Cell Differentiation Model 
*The dynamics of two, undifferentiated and differentiated subpopulations are presented by the sketch:

gc, gu, and gd are, respectively, self-renewal rate of undifferentiated cells, differentiation rate, and self-renewal rate of differentiated cells in day-1 units.

We solve the system of ODSs and find analytical expressions for U(t) and D(t). Subsequently, we fit the function to the experimental data below and determine the  gc, gu, and gd rates for two substrates. Finally, we use the estimated rates to predict U(8) and D(8).
